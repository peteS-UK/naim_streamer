# Naim Streamer Integration for Home Assistant

A simple media player to control Naim Streamers from Home Assistant.

It's initially tested with NDX.

The original NDX only provides a basic UpNP interface with play, pause, stop etc. support. Although the metadata is shown for all sources, the commands only work with the UPnP input. However, if you select a Broadlink remote during setup, all of the buttons from the remote are implemented and work across all inputs.
